graph generation:

[] ladder graphs
[] 2d grid graphs
[] trees, uniformly randomly generated from the Pruffer sequence
[] erdos-renyi graphs with edge probability min(logV/V, 0.5)
[] barabasi-albert graphs, attaching either four or five edges to every incoming node
[] 4-community graphs - first generating four disjoint erdos-renyi graphs with edge probability 0.7, followed by interconnecting their nodes with edge probability 0.01
[] 4-caveman graphs, having each of their intra-clique edges removed with probability 0.7, followed by inserting 0.025|V| additional shortcut edges between cliques

implementation of graph algorithms

[] topological sort
[] dfs

[] create dataset generation given (graph_type, nb_graphs, nb_nodes, algorithm_type)
